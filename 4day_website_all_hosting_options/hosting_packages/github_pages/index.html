        <h1>4-Day School Week Research & Implementation</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; color: #666;">Mount Maunganui College</p>

        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This comprehensive resource presents research findings and implementation options for a 4-day school week at Mount Maunganui College. Based on extensive research of schools currently using this model, analysis of academic and wellbeing outcomes, and consideration of the specific context of Mount Maunganui College.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Context:</strong> The 4-day school week has gained significant traction internationally, with more than 2,100 public schools adopting this model. Initially implemented primarily as a cost-saving measure during economic downturns, the model has evolved to address teacher recruitment and retention challenges, particularly in the post-pandemic educational landscape.
            </div>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Prevalence</h4>
                    <p>Several schools across New Zealand and Australia are exploring flexible scheduling models, with Crimson Global Academy and Te Kura pioneering approaches that align with 4-day week principles.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Academic Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>Research shows maintaining equivalent weekly instructional hours is crucial for academic outcomes. New Zealand schools implementing flexible scheduling models report positive results when total learning time is preserved.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Teacher Retention</h4>
                    <p>Significant improvements in teacher recruitment and retention, with improved teacher morale, reduced burnout, and better work-life balance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Student Wellbeing</h4>
                    <p>High student satisfaction with benefits for rest, recovery, and extracurricular engagement. Parents report additional family time and reduced stress.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Future Skills</h4>
                    <p>Direct alignment with World Economic Forum capabilities including creative thinking, resilience, technological literacy, and AI proficiency essential for future workforce success.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>Strategic Educational Innovation</h4>
                <p>Implementing a 4-day school week represents more than a scheduling change—it's a strategic educational innovation that prepares students for the future of work. The World Economic Forum identifies this model as directly supporting the development of critical 21st-century capabilities including carbon intelligence, virtual intelligence, and AI proficiency.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Implementation Options</h3>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Option 1: Split Student Groups</h4>
                    <p><strong>Mon-Thurs and Tues-Fri cohorts</strong></p>
                    <p>One cohort of students attends Monday through Thursday, while another cohort attends Tuesday through Friday. This approach maintains a 5-day operational week for the school while providing each student with a 4-day instructional week.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Option 2: Online/Flipped Classroom</h4>
                    <p><strong>5 in-person periods + 1 online period</strong></p>
                    <p>Students attend 5 in-person periods and complete the 6th period remotely. This hybrid approach develops digital literacy and student autonomy while enabling earlier physical dismissal and maintaining instructional time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Option 3: Year-Level Split</h4>
                    <p><strong>Years 9-10 on 5-day, Years 11-13 on 4-day</strong></p>
                    <p>Maintain a traditional 5-day schedule for Years 9-10 while implementing a 4-day week for Years 11-13 (senior students). This approach recognises the different needs and maturity levels of students at various stages.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Schools that maintain equal or greater instructional time (by extending the remaining four days) see fewer negative impacts</li>
                    <li>Schools that reduce total instructional time when adopting 4-day schedules tend to see more negative outcomes</li>
                    <li>Research consistently shows that maintaining equivalent weekly instructional hours is crucial for academic outcomes</li>
                    <li>New Zealand schools implementing flexible scheduling models report positive results when total learning time is preserved</li>

                <h4>Legal and Regulatory Considerations</h4>
                <p>Implementation of a 4-day school week in New Zealand public schools would require government approval due to existing legal requirements for the number of school days per year. The Education and Training Act 2020 and associated regulations specify minimum instructional hours and days that must be met.</p>
                <p><strong>Pilot Programme Proposal:</strong> Mount Maunganui College could serve as an ideal pilot site for a 4-day school week in New Zealand. As a pilot, the school could work with the Ministry of Education to obtain special dispensation to trial this innovative approach while ensuring all educational outcomes and requirements are met.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>Post Primary Teachers' Association Requirements</h4>
                <p>Implementation of a 4-day school week would require comprehensive consultation with the PPTA as the representative body for secondary school teachers in New Zealand.</p>
                
                <h4>Union Consultation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early and meaningful consultation with PPTA representatives is essential before any pilot implementation</li>
                    <li>Teacher feedback and concerns must be addressed through formal consultation processes</li>
                    <li>Union support would be crucial for successful implementation and teacher buy-in</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Collective Agreement Implications</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes to working hours and conditions would need to be negotiated within existing collective agreements</li>
                    <li>Potential impacts on teacher workload, preparation time, and professional development opportunities must be assessed</li>
                    <li>Compensation and working condition adjustments may be required</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Implementation Working Group</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establishment of a joint working group including PPTA representatives, school leadership, and Ministry of Education officials</li>
                    <li>Regular monitoring and evaluation of teacher wellbeing and working conditions during any pilot phase</li>
                    <li>Clear protocols for addressing concerns and making adjustments based on teacher feedback</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Legal Precedent</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any pilot programme would need to establish clear legal frameworks for future implementations</li>
                    <li>Documentation of union consultation processes and agreements for reference by other schools</li>
                    <li>Alignment with employment law and education sector collective agreements</li>
